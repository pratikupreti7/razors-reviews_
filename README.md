Project: Razors N' Reviews - A Covid-Aware Salon Review Platform

 Razors N' Reviews, a full-stack web application developed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This project stands out because it addressed a critical need during a challenging time, combining technical innovation with social responsibility.

Motivation:
In 2021, as the world was grappling with Covid-19, I recognized a gap in the market for beauty services. People wanted to return to salons but were concerned about safety. I envisioned a platform that would not only help users discover high-quality beauty treatments but also provide crucial information about each salon's adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols.

Technical Implementation:
1. Backend: Developed using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database.
2. Frontend: Built with React and Redux for state management.
3. Authentication: Implemented JWT for secure user authentication.
4. Cloud Integration: Utilized Cloudinary API for efficient image upload and management of salon photos.
5. Covid Rating System: Created a unique, system-generated questionnaire for Covid safety ratings.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: Robust login/signup functionality.
2. Salon Management: Users could add new salons, edit existing ones, and upload multiple pictures.
3. Review System: Implemented a comprehensive review system, including the novel Covid safety ratings.
4. Search and Filters: Advanced search functionality with multiple filters to help users find salons meeting their specific criteria.
5. User Profiles: Users could create and update their profiles, adding a personal touch to the platform.

Challenges and Solutions:
One of the main challenges was creating an intuitive interface for the Covid safety questionnaire. I solved this by implementing a dynamic form that adjusted based on user inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience while collecting detailed information.

Another challenge was optimizing image uploads for a seamless experience. I overcame this by implementing client-side image compression before upload and utilizing Cloudinary's transformation APIs for efficient image delivery.
